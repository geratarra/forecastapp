# forecastapp
This is just a little project I've created to get started with React. It's been I while since I don't play with the library (actually I think I haven't play with it for real) and I don't want to get outdated.
Nothing fancy, responsive or things like that. Just a simple little app made with love :heart:. I would really link to keep working with React so I would see if I can code some apps with some of the common and popular topics around React (like Redux and stuff..). We'll see..
